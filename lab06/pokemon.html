<div class="card favorite" id="pokemon1">
        <img alt = "pokemon1"  src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/a0/Pikachu_SSB4.png">
        <div class="name">  Pikachu</div>
        <p> In the hands of a skilled player, Pikachu is not to be taken lightly. Alongside electrical attacks, it has very good aerial attacks and superb, but hard to master, recovery move. Pikachu is also one of the lightest characters in the game, making it easy for its foes to launch it. </p>

    <div class="card" id="pokemon2">
            <img alt = "pokemon2"  src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/a6/Jigglypuff_SSB4.png">
            <div class="name">  Jigglypuff</div>
            <p> Jigglypuff is a playable character, but it must be unlocked by clearing the 1-Player mode with any character. Jigglypuff has one of the best recoveries in the game and can use its low-power aerial attacks to combo larger and heavier opponents easily, but it also the lightest character and thus very easy to knock off the stage. </p>
        </div>    

        <div class="card" id="pokemon3">
                <img alt = "pokemon3"  src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/e/ea/PMD_Uxie_art.png">
                <div class="name">  Uxie</div>
                <p> Despite being genderless in the core series, both Uxie and Azelf are referred to as males, while Mesprit is referred to as a female; however, during gameplay they are treated as genderless. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="card" id="pokemon4">
                    <img alt = "pokemon4"  src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/a/af/Lucario_SSB4.png">
                    <div class="name">  Lucario</div>
                    <p> Lucario can be unlocked by either playing 100 matches, completing all five target smashes with a single character, or recruiting him in the Subspace Emissary. His home stage is Spear Pillar. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="card favorite" id="pokemon5">
                        <img alt = "pokemon5"  src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/c/c1/Charizard_SSB4.png">
                        <div class="name">  Charizard</div>
                        <p> Charizard appears as a Pokémon that can be randomly summoned from a Poké Ball. When Charizard appears, it attacks the enemies of the player/team that summoned it with a scorching Flamethrower while turning its head from left to right. The attack deal 6% damage per flame in both games. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card favorite" id="pokemon6">
                            <img alt = "pokemon6"  src="https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/5/5e/Greninja_SSB4.png">
                            <div class="name">  Greninja</div>
                            <p> Greninja is a swift, agile fighter that uses its speed to keep opponents on their toes, and is able to keep able opponents at bay thanks to its powerful Water Shuriken. According to Masahiro Sakurai, Greninja was already being developed as a playable character before Pokémon X and Y were announced. Greninja is the last character to make its debut in a Nintendo game sans DLC, and thus is the last opponent faced in Super Smash Bros. </p>
