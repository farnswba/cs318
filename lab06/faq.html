<h3> I'm running a Mac and get an error message when I click Download Tool Now. What's wrong?</h3>
<p class="Answer">The media creation tool (Download Tool Now button) will not run on a Mac device. You can still 
    download an ISO file with one of these options: Windows 8.1 or Windows 10. This will give you 
    a web-based download option that should run on most browsers.</p>

    <h3> Windows came pre-installed on my device, can I use media from this site to download and install?</h3>
<p class="Answer">Before using operating system copies from this site for install, re-install or recovery on devices with 
    pre-installed operating systems, see your device manufacturer or reseller for the customized drivers and 
    applications specific to your machine. Using operating systems copied from this site for install, re-install
    or recovery may void your support agreement with your manufacturer or reseller. Any drivers or programs that
     were installed by the device manufacturer or reseller may be removed during installation.</p>

    <h3> I have a non-Windows device (like an Apple) and I want to run Windows on it. Where do I get this media?</h3>
<p class="Answer">You can download an ISO file copy of Windows to use with a non-Windows device. Follow these links for Windows 10, 
    Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 ISO download options best for non-Windows devices.</p>
