                    <h1>Tigers Back.</h1>
                  This can mean whatever you want it to mean. However, for me, as a huge golf fan and Tiger Woods fan, I am thrilled to see him back out on the course again. Watching golf tournaments without him on the course was not the same. Yes, we are currently blessed with guys like Dustin Johnson, Jordan Spieth, Rickie Folwer, Justin Thomas, Jason Day and Rory Mcllroy. But a golf world without Mr. Tiger Woods was not one that I enjoyed living in.
      
     <h2> He's Back...</h2>
      Many people can sit back and question Tiger's ability to keep playing, but I'm not so sure what they are questioning at the moment. Tiger has his power back. Not only does he have the power back, but he has been consistently able to play with it in back to back tournaments without barring any setbacks. He is absolutely nuking the ball again. Not only does this have to do with health and power, but how about that fist pump of his?!
      Oh yeah, we have seen a couple of those in his return as well. Tiger is hungry and competitive as ever and it's only a matter of time before he puts it all together. Hopefully we get to see him put on that Masters Green Jacket at least one more time before it's all said and done.
      
      <h3>Welcome back Tiger, I love you.</h3>
