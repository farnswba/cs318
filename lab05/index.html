                    The links above direct you to pages that show our day-to-day excursions during our vacation in Orlando, Florida. 
                    On Monday, we went to Lake Eola and the Universal Waterfall Cinema.
                    On Tuesday, we went on a helicopter ride around Orlando to get wonderful views of the city. Following this, we stopped by Mead Gardens (Trevor's favorite part of the trip.)
                    On Wednesday, we hit the golf course and the WWE arena. Brady showed Trevor the ropes on how to shoot even par.
                    On Thursday, we wrapped up our trip with a Shamu Show at Sea World and polished off the rest of our day with a relaxing pool day.
